React mini project created to showcase sorting and filtering of Restaurant records.

1. In this app user can filter records based on the indetifying labels (E.g. French, Pub, VegetarianFriendly, GlutenFreeOptions and so on).

2. Sorting can be done by ranking (Low to High and High to Low).

3. Restaurant Records' JSON data is stored on github in a different repo and is being fetched using Axios.

Demo is hosted here: https://mishabatsiashvili.github.io/ReactFilterRestaurantsRecordsHooks/

JSON data can be viewed at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MishaBatsiashvili/myJsonPlaceholder/master/db.json
